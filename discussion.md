There is so much overlap with some of this and with the shell-novice lesson.

Initial material is for a system with these attributes:
* login via ssh with password.
* Torque scheduler
* environment modules
* currently the hostname used is cowboy.hpc.okstate.edu (maybe sed can be used to replace all that with other hostnames)

(will add more as noticed)

Attempts have been made not to use system specific language except where unavoidable.

Should learners go through the shell-novice lesson first?  Or should the relevant material be replicated here.
