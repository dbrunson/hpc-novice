HPC-novice
==========

First introduction to using High Performance Computing

HPC systems can be very different, but many things are
the same.

This repository was created from the directions here:
https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example

Current plan is to link to the shell-novice lesson where appropriate with special instructions perhaps to do the lesson on a remote server (login node or interactive queue as appropriate.)  [http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)


To use a remote server for the shell-novice lesson, just acquire the data file after login like this:

 $ wget http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/shell-novice-data.zip

 $ unzip shell-novice-data.zip

There'll be differences in the path names between `/` and `data`, but there always are anyway depending on the OS the learners are using.
