HPC-novice
==========

First introduction to using High Performance Computing

HPC systems can be very different, but many things are
the same.

This repository was created from the directions here:
https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example

Current plan is to link to the shell-novice lesson where appropriate with special instructions perhaps to do the lesson on a remote server (login node or interactive queue as appropriate.)  [http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
