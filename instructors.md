## Overall

The target learner for this lesson is someone without much
if any computing experience beyond their (typically)  Windows 
desktop.

The target learner will (at first at least) want to use an 
application installed by others with their own input/data.

Keep the beginning simple and successful and try not to 
introduce non-essential concepts.
